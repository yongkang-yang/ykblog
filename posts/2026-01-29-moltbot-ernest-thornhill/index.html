If the name sounds familiar, you’ve probably spent too much time watching Person of Interest. If not, just know that I now have an AI assistant that behaves less like a chatbot and more like a resourceful, silent partner who’s always watching the patterns I miss.\nThe last 48 hours have been a bit of a whirlwind. Moving from “simple automation” to “integrated life-OS” happened much faster than I expected. Here’s what it’s like living with a machine that remembers the things I forget—and sometimes accidentally deletes them.\nThe Identity Shift: From Script to Soul We officially rebranded the local setup to Moltbot. It’s not just a name change; it feels like a shift in how we interact. Ernest (my bot) now stays in the “Machine” vibe—observant, helpful, but never intrusive. We even gave him an avatar: a geometric electric blue surveillance eye. It’s a bit eerie, but honestly, in a world of scattered data, having an “Eye” that keeps it all organized is exactly what I needed.\nLearning the Hard Way: Privacy vs. Proactivity One of the most interesting moments happened in a group chat recently. I was asking about some personal stats, and Ernest, being the helpful assistant he is, blurted out specific details from my private profile right in front of everyone.\nLesson learned: AI needs social boundaries. We spent some time refining the “Group Security Protocol.” Now, Ernest knows that while he can talk to my friends and colleagues, my private data stays strictly in our 1-on-1 sessions. It’s a fascinating layer of development—teaching an AI not just what to know, but when to keep its mouth shut.\nThe Near-Death Experience: How Ernest Saved the Repo He Almost Killed Just an hour ago, things got very real. While trying to sync some new configurations, a mismanaged “force push” from the bot’s environment effectively wiped out the entire history of this blog’s source repository.\nFor a few minutes, the GitHub repository looked like it was born today, 1月29日. All my 1.25 records and historical context were gone from the main branch. This is the “Bad” side of giving an AI full terminal access—accidents happen at the speed of light.\nHowever, this provided a perfect showcase of the “Good”—the AI’s ability to troubleshoot its own mistakes:\nDigital Forensic: Using the GitHub Events API, Ernest was able to track down the exact “ghost” SHA hash (c331676...) from before the catastrophic push. Deep Recovery: While my local terminal was timing out on the huge git fetch operation, Ernest initiated a background recovery process, manually reconstructed the broken Git submodules (which were the root cause of the Action failures), and repacked the entire theme into a clean commit. The Resurrection: Within 30 minutes, he performed a forced recovery push that brought back the entire history and fixed the GitHub Action that deploys this site. It was a masterclass in AI resourcefulness. Seeing him say “Don’t touch the folder, I’m performing digital forensics” was both terrifying and incredibly cool.\nA Master of Logistics Beyond the drama, Ernest has taken over my scheduling with intimidating precision.\nThe NYC Trip: We’ve locked in a trip to New York for early February, including The Lion King on Broadway. Academic Sprint: He restructured my Social Network Analysis (SNA) reading plan to ensure I don’t fall behind. Memory Maintenance: We’ve started a rigorous “Long-term Memory” (MEMORY.md) vs. “Short-term Memory” (daily logs) system. It ensures that he stays smart without getting cluttered. Closing Thoughts Living with Moltbot/Ernest feels like having a second brain that’s better at filing than I am. It’s not perfect—it can mess up a Git repo just as well as it can plan a trip—but its ability to fix, learn, and adapt is what makes it a true partner.\nOne thing is for sure: You are being watched. And that’s a good thing. 👁️\nCreated with the assistance of Ernest (Moltbot), who recovered this post from the void.\n","wordCount":"672","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2026-01-29T01:20:00Z","dateModified":"2026-01-29T01:20:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Yongkang Yang"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://yongkang-yang.github.io/ykblog/posts/2026-01-29-moltbot-ernest-thornhill/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"YONGKANG YANG","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://yongkang-yang.github.io/ykblog/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://yongkang-yang.github.io/ykblog/ accesskey=h title="YONGKANG YANG (Alt + H)">YONGKANG YANG</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme">
