The outcome is repeatedly measured in the moderation. 

There are two papers explaining the methods behind:

2. Preacher, K. J., Curran, P. J., & Bauer, D. J. (2006). Computational tools for probing interactions in multiple linear regression, multilevel modeling, and latent curve analysis. Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, 31(4), 437-448.

Though moderation was not a main focus in this classic paper, gender as a moderator appeared in the growth modeling.
