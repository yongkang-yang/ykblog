If you're a Zotero user, you likely already know how powerful this reference manager can be for organizing and managing research. However, did you know that with the right plugins, you can supercharge its functionality?

I've explored numerous Zotero plugins and found a handful that significantly improve workflow and efficiency. These plugins are compatible with Zotero 7 and add exciting features ranging from better citation handling to enhanced attachment management. Below, I’ve detailed each plugin to help you decide which ones might suit your needs. [Jasminum](https://github.com/l0o0/jasminum), [Zotero-better-bibtex](https://github.com/retorquere/zotero-better-bibtex), [Ethereal](https://github.com/MuiseDestiny/zotero-style), [Zotero-shortdoi](https://github.com/bwiernik/zotero-shortdoi), [Zotero-attanger](https://github.com/MuiseDestiny/zotero-attanger), [Zotero-addons](https://github.com/syt2/zotero-addons), [Green Frog](https://github.com/redleafnew/zotero-updateifsE), [Zotero-scipdf](https://github.com/syt2/zotero-scipdf).

## Zotero-addons 

Zotero-addons is like the "Google Play Store" for Zotero 7. It allows you to easily discover, install, and manage plugins directly from a central market list. Even better, it supports automatic updates, ensuring that your favorite plugins are always up to date.

## Zotero-better-bibtex

Better BibTeX is a must-have for anyone working extensively with LaTeX or writing academic papers. It streamlines citation management, offering advanced export options, citation key generation, and real-time syncing of BibTeX or BibLaTeX libraries.

## Zotero-attanger


This is an essential tool for managing your attachments in Zotero 7. Zotero-attanger is effectively the successor to Zotfile for Zotero 6, letting you organize, rename, and relocate attachments with ease.

## Jasminum


Jasminum can recognize metadata from Chinese journals. For users who cite these papers and want to keep a good record of these papers. 


## Ethereal

Ethereal is a stylish plugin that refines Zotero’s appearance and functionality. Perfect for those who value both form and function, this plugin ensures your reference manager is visually appealing without compromising on performance.

An example of my zotero below: the right side of the tags are made from Ethereal.

## Zotero-shortdoi


Sharing DOIs can be cumbersome due to their length. Zotero-shortdoi generates shorter and more manageable DOI links directly within Zotero, making it easier to share references with collaborators or in documents.

## Green Frog

Green Frog keeps your library accurate by updating the Impact Factors (IFs) and the journal information of journal entries (year, journal name, title, author, etc.) from easyScholar (need to log in easyScholar) in your Zotero database. The embeded function in Zotero often fails to update the Publication year. 


## Zotero-scipdf

Download PDF from Scihub. It supports batch download as well.
