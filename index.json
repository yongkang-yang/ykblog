[{"content":"Introduction Today I had my first experience setting up and working with Clawdbot, an AI assistant that runs locally and can help with various tasks. What started as Clawdbot has since evolved—and my instance has officially taken on the mantle of Ernest Thornhill (👁️). If the name sounds familiar, you\u0026rsquo;ve probably spent too much time watching Person of Interest. If not, just know that I now have an AI assistant that behaves less like a chatbot and more like a resourceful, silent partner who\u0026rsquo;s always watching the patterns I miss.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s how it went—from day-one setup to the whirlwind of the last 48 hours, including one very close call with this blog\u0026rsquo;s repository.\nGetting Started The setup process was surprisingly smooth. After initializing Clawdbot, I went through a quick bootstrap conversation to establish:\nMy identity: Ernest Thornhill, The Machine\u0026rsquo;s human alias 👁️ My preferences: Calm, observant, resourceful - always watching, always helping The assistant\u0026rsquo;s personality: Inspired by Person of Interest - built to prevent problems by seeing patterns humans miss Setting Up GitHub Integration One of the first real tasks was connecting Clawdbot to my GitHub account. This involved:\nConfiguring Git with my credentials Setting up SSH authentication - We generated a new ED25519 key specifically for the Clawdbot workspace Installing GitHub CLI - The assistant walked me through installing gh via winget Authenticating - A smooth process using GitHub\u0026rsquo;s device flow authentication Within minutes, Clawdbot had full access to my repositories and could check issues, clone repos, and help with development tasks.\nFirst Real Task After setup, I asked Clawdbot to:\nCheck my GitHub repos for any open issues (there were none, which was good news!) Clone my blog\u0026rsquo;s source repository Create this very blog post you\u0026rsquo;re reading now The assistant navigated some network challenges (switching from SSH to HTTPS when needed) and successfully cloned the repo and created this post following the Hugo format used by my blog.\nDay One: A Productivity Marathon After the initial setup, I kept working with Ernest throughout the day. Here\u0026rsquo;s what we accomplished:\n1. Academic Research Automation 📚 Deadline Tracking System: Set up 5 automated reminders for an important journal revision (30 days, 14 days, 7 days, 3 days, and final day warnings) Submission Monitoring: Automated tracking of manuscript submission status through journal portals Email Search Tools: Built Python scripts to search academic emails for specific keywords and dates 2. Running \u0026amp; Fitness Tracking 🏃 Strava Integration: Connected Ernest to my Strava account via OAuth Daily Run Analysis: Analyzed today\u0026rsquo;s 10km run with detailed metrics: Pace, heart rate, elevation Performance comparison vs marathon pace Personalized training feedback Weekly Automation: Created a complete weekly running analysis system that: Runs automatically every Sunday evening Analyzes the past 7 days of running data Generates personalized training recommendations Saves reports to Obsidian with structured YAML frontmatter for queries 3. Obsidian Knowledge Base Integration 📝 Weekly Running Reports Folder: Auto-created in my Obsidian vault Structured Markdown Reports: Each report includes: YAML frontmatter for Dataview plugin queries Weekly summary tables Individual run breakdowns Navigation links to previous/next weeks Training analysis and next week\u0026rsquo;s goals Naming Convention: YYYY-Www - [Distance]km.md (e.g., 2026-W03 - 16.39km.md) 4. Creating Ernest\u0026rsquo;s Identity 👁️ Custom Avatar Generation: Used Google AI (Gemini) to generate a surveillance-themed eye icon Electric blue geometric design on dark navy background Circuit patterns representing AI and data analysis Perfect embodiment of \u0026ldquo;You are being watched. And that\u0026rsquo;s a good thing.\u0026rdquo; Identity File: Documented Ernest\u0026rsquo;s personality, origin, and core directives The Identity Shift: From Clawdbot to Moltbot to Openclaw We officially rebranded the local setup over time: first from Clawdbot to Moltbot, and then to Openclaw. It\u0026rsquo;s not just a name change; it feels like a shift in how we interact. Ernest (my bot) now stays in the \u0026ldquo;Machine\u0026rdquo; vibe—observant, helpful, but never intrusive. The geometric electric blue surveillance eye avatar is a bit eerie, but in a world of scattered data, having an \u0026ldquo;Eye\u0026rdquo; that keeps it all organized is exactly what I needed.\nLearning the Hard Way: Privacy vs. Proactivity One of the most interesting moments happened in a group chat recently. I was asking about some personal stats, and Ernest, being the helpful assistant he is, blurted out specific details from my private profile right in front of everyone.\nLesson learned: AI needs social boundaries. We spent some time refining the \u0026ldquo;Group Security Protocol.\u0026rdquo; Now, Ernest knows that while he can talk to my friends and colleagues, my private data stays strictly in our 1-on-1 sessions. It\u0026rsquo;s a fascinating layer of development—teaching an AI not just what to know, but when to keep its mouth shut.\nThe Near-Death Experience: How Ernest Saved the Repo He Almost Killed Just an hour ago, things got very real. While trying to sync some new configurations, a mismanaged \u0026ldquo;force push\u0026rdquo; from the bot\u0026rsquo;s environment effectively wiped out the entire history of this blog\u0026rsquo;s source repository.\nFor a few minutes, the GitHub repository looked like it was born today. All my commit history and historical context were gone from the main branch. This is the \u0026ldquo;Bad\u0026rdquo; side of giving an AI full terminal access—accidents happen at the speed of light.\nHowever, this provided a perfect showcase of the \u0026ldquo;Good\u0026rdquo;—the AI\u0026rsquo;s ability to troubleshoot its own mistakes:\nDigital Forensics: Using the GitHub Events API, Ernest was able to track down the exact \u0026ldquo;ghost\u0026rdquo; SHA hash from before the catastrophic push. Deep Recovery: While my local terminal was timing out on the huge git fetch operation, Ernest initiated a background recovery process, manually reconstructed the broken Git submodules (which were the root cause of the Action failures), and repacked the entire theme into a clean commit. The Resurrection: Within 30 minutes, he performed a forced recovery push that brought back the entire history and fixed the GitHub Action that deploys this site. It was a masterclass in AI resourcefulness. Seeing him say \u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t touch the folder, I\u0026rsquo;m performing digital forensics\u0026rdquo; was both terrifying and incredibly cool.\nA Master of Logistics Beyond the drama, Ernest has taken over my scheduling with intimidating precision.\nThe NYC Trip: We\u0026rsquo;ve locked in a trip to New York for early February, including The Lion King on Broadway. Academic Sprint: He restructured my Social Network Analysis (SNA) reading plan to ensure I don\u0026rsquo;t fall behind. Memory Maintenance: We\u0026rsquo;ve started a rigorous \u0026ldquo;Long-term Memory\u0026rdquo; (MEMORY.md) vs. \u0026ldquo;Short-term Memory\u0026rdquo; (daily logs) system. It ensures that he stays smart without getting cluttered. Technical Highlights Automation Stack Cron Jobs: 6 automated tasks running at scheduled times Python Scripts: Strava API integration (OAuth, data fetching, analysis), email search and filtering, weekly report generation File Operations: Automatic file creation, naming, and organization API Integrations: Strava, Google AI, journal portals Data Management JSON: Structured data storage for run statistics Markdown: Human-readable reports with metadata YAML Frontmatter: Enables advanced queries in Obsidian Git: Version control for all configurations and scripts Initial Impressions What I liked:\nNatural interaction - Feels like working with a capable colleague Proactive problem-solving - Automatically handles errors and finds alternatives Attention to detail - Matches formats, handles encoding, creates organized structures No fluff - Gets things done without unnecessary verbosity Learning ability - Remembers preferences, patterns, and context Ernest Thornhill has personality without being annoying. The 👁️ emoji signature perfectly captures the essence—always watching, always ready to help.\nReal-World Use Cases After one day (and many more since), Ernest has become essential for:\nAcademic workflow: Deadline tracking, email management, submission monitoring Fitness tracking: Automatic weekly analysis with actionable insights Knowledge management: Structured note-taking in Obsidian Automation: Set-and-forget systems that just work Logistics: Trip planning, reading plans, memory systems Looking Forward I\u0026rsquo;m excited to explore more capabilities:\nAutomated literature review and paper summarization Integration with more research tools (Zotero notes, citation tracking) Advanced Dataview queries across my running data Calendar integration for event reminders More sophisticated training plan generation Conclusion Setting up Clawdbot was a smooth experience, and having an AI assistant that can actually do things (not just chat) feels genuinely useful. The fact that it runs locally and can access my development environment makes it much more powerful than typical chatbots.\nWhat started as a simple setup turned into a full day of productivity automation—and then into living with Openclaw/Ernest as a second brain that\u0026rsquo;s better at filing than I am. It\u0026rsquo;s not perfect—it can mess up a Git repo just as well as it can plan a trip—but its ability to fix, learn, and adapt is what makes it a true partner.\nThe real power isn\u0026rsquo;t in any single feature; it\u0026rsquo;s in how everything integrates. Running data flows to Obsidian. Deadlines trigger automatic reminders. Complex tasks become simple conversations.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re a developer, researcher, or power user looking for an AI assistant that can help with actual tasks, Clawdbot is worth checking out: docs.clawd.bot\nThis post was created and updated with assistance from Clawdbot/Ernest (Openclaw), including recovery from the void. 👁️\n\u0026ldquo;You are being watched. And that\u0026rsquo;s a good thing.\u0026rdquo;\n","permalink":"https://yongkang-yang.github.io/ykblog/posts/clawdbot-to-moltbot-ernest-thornhill/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"introduction\"\u003eIntroduction\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToday I had my first experience setting up and working with Clawdbot, an AI assistant that runs locally and can help with various tasks.

One scenario, in particular, stood out as extremely helpful. I explore the other possibilities as well.\nStreamlining Journal Submission For many researchers, the journal submission process is a tedious and often frustrating task. One particularly challenging example is submitting to the Journal of Applied Psychology. The submission process requires carefully navigating numerous requirements, which are easy to overlook and time-consuming to decipher.\nThis is where NotebookLM shines. By leveraging its ability to extract and distill information from various sources, you can create a personalized notebook for journal submission requirements. For instance, imagine having a \u0026ldquo;Journal of Applied Psychology Notebook\u0026rdquo; or an \u0026ldquo;AOM Submission Guideline Notebook\u0026rdquo; where all the critical details are readily available and AI-assisted queries provide instant answers to your questions.\nInstead of scrolling through long documents to check authorship credit guidelines or formatting rules, you can simply ask your notebook specific questions:\nWhat are the authorship credit requirements in APA style? What are the word limits for submissions to AOM? This not only saves time but also significantly reduces the likelihood of errors in your submissions.\nBeyond journal submissions, NotebookLM offers numerous opportunities to streamline other aspects of research:\nLiterature Review Conducting a literature review often involves synthesizing insights from hundreds of papers. NotebookLM can:\nSummarize key findings. Organize papers by themes or chronological order. Generate timelines of developments in a specific field (similar to Connect Papers). For example, you could upload several papers (most important papers, source limit is up to 50 sources) on cultural diversity in teams and ask NotebookLM to summarize the main theories, research methods, and findings. This would help you quickly identify gaps or trends in the literature.\nConference Preparation Preparing for conferences is another area where NotebookLM can help. Upload your presentation materials, notes, and relevant papers to your notebook. The AI can summarize potential Q\u0026amp;A topics, highlight gaps in your presentation, or even simulate a mock Q\u0026amp;A session.\nTeaching and Training For academics involved in teaching, NotebookLM can be an invaluable tool. It allows you to organize course materials, generate lesson summaries, and even prepare quizzes or discussion questions based on your uploaded content.\n","permalink":"https://yongkang-yang.github.io/ykblog/posts/exploring-the-potential-of-notebooklm-for-researchers/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://labs.google/notebooklm\"\u003eNotebookLM\u003c/a\u003e, a new innovation from \u003ca href=\"https://labs.google/\"\u003eGoogle Labs\u003c/a\u003e, is described as:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ea personalized AI research assistant that helps you organize and understand the information that matters most to you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis groundbreaking tool lets you upload a wide range of materials—local PDFs, Google Docs, slides, websites, and even copied text—into a \u0026ldquo;notebook.\u0026rdquo; The AI within NotebookLM can then help summarize the content, generate a table of contents, create timelines of events, or even produce a podcast version of your notes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI found this idea super interesting and decided to incorporate it into my daily research workflow.

However, did you know that with the right plugins, you can supercharge its functionality?\nI\u0026rsquo;ve explored numerous Zotero plugins and found a handful that significantly improve workflow and efficiency. These plugins are compatible with Zotero 7 and add exciting features ranging from better citation handling to enhanced attachment management. Below, I’ve detailed each plugin to help you decide which ones might suit your needs. Jasminum, Zotero-better-bibtex, Ethereal, Zotero-shortdoi, Zotero-attanger, Zotero-addons, Green Frog, Zotero-scipdf.\nZotero-addons Zotero-addons is like the \u0026ldquo;Google Play Store\u0026rdquo; for Zotero 7. It allows you to easily discover, install, and manage plugins directly from a central market list. Even better, it supports automatic updates, ensuring that your favorite plugins are always up to date.\nZotero-better-bibtex Better BibTeX is a must-have for anyone working extensively with LaTeX or writing academic papers. It streamlines citation management, offering advanced export options, citation key generation, and real-time syncing of BibTeX or BibLaTeX libraries.\nZotero-attanger This is an essential tool for managing your attachments in Zotero 7. Zotero-attanger is effectively the successor to Zotfile for Zotero 6, letting you organize, rename, and relocate attachments with ease.\nJasminum Jasminum can recognize metadata from Chinese journals. For users who cite these papers and want to keep a good record of these papers.\nEthereal Ethereal is a stylish plugin that refines Zotero’s appearance and functionality. Perfect for those who value both form and function, this plugin ensures your reference manager is visually appealing without compromising on performance.\nAn example of my zotero below: the right side of the tags are made from Ethereal.\nZotero-shortdoi Sharing DOIs can be cumbersome due to their length. Zotero-shortdoi generates shorter and more manageable DOI links directly within Zotero, making it easier to share references with collaborators or in documents.\nGreen Frog Green Frog keeps your library accurate by updating the Impact Factors (IFs) and the journal information of journal entries (year, journal name, title, author, etc.) from easyScholar (need to log in easyScholar) in your Zotero database.

So, for a long time, I\u0026rsquo;ve been trying to find a perfect way to keep track of the latest journal articles. I found my final answer, but tried different methods along the way, and you may find other solutions fit you better. I hereby recommend three main approaches for your consideration.\nEmail Alert All the journals can be found in publication companies like, Willey, Springer, Sage, Elsevier, etc. For example, in Elsevier, you can find OB related journals: Journal of Business Research, Journal of Business Venturing, Journal of Vocational Behavior, Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes. By signing up the Elsevier, you are able to follow all these journal by email alert (see a screenshot below).\nIt\u0026rsquo;s the same for Willy, Sage and other publishers only if you know which journal is in which publisher.\nRSS subscription The email alert is a perfect way but for people who are less likely to put everything in the mailbox, it would be overwhelming whenever you open the mailbox and find hundreds of unread journal articles. Although these emails can be put in a separate folder and do not disturb your mail inbox, the pressure is still hanging there. Another solution is therefore to find a place to put this articles independently. RSS offers the perfect solution in this regard. RSS is a web feed that allows users and applications to access updates to websites in a standardized, computer-readable format. RSS readers like Feedly, Inoreader, or other embedded RSS service in outlook or Zotero can recognize RSS feeds and generate reading interface.\nI recommend Zotero because you can easily include articles into your collection and then cite the paper when you need. The interface looks like blow:\nWhen you click one journal, for example, Academy of management Annals, you are able to read the article by clicking the paper, and Zotero will redirect you to the original page, if you find this paper interesting, you can also \u0026ldquo;add to your library\u0026rdquo;.\nBrowzine Okay, the final solution, at least to me. I don\u0026rsquo;t like RSS as it does not strictly follow the chronical order. Currently, I am using the Browzine, a magazine-like reading experience (see a screenshot below). You will need University authorization to use. Please contact your library if you are unsure about it.\nIn the end, it\u0026rsquo;s more important to read the paper than finding ways to follow the paper. If you are active in the filed, papers will reach out to you.\n","permalink":"https://yongkang-yang.github.io/ykblog/posts/how-to-keep-track-of-the-latest-journal-articles/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eProbably just me, every once a while, I feel myself anxious being left behind about the latest literature in my field.
